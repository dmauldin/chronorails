= Chronorails

Chronorails handles adding virtual attributes to your models (with suitable validations, etc) allowing you to set date and duration fields with natural language text.

== Installation

  gem install chronorails

== Usage

For a hypothetical Rails model:

  class RomanticMeeting < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_accessible :length, :start # Integer and DateTime DB fields, respectively

    include Chronorails::ChronicAccessors
    chronic_field :start, :required => true, :validates => true
    chronic_duration_field :length, :validates => true
  end

...include the accessors module, and config Chronorails to start wrapping your attributes with either Chronic or Chronic Duration virtual attributes.

Then in your form:

  <%= f.text_field :chronic_start %>
  <%= f.text_field :chronic_duration_length %>

...you can use the virtual attributes for your fields, entering natural language date and duration information that will be parsed into the regular fields (or will generate validation errors).
